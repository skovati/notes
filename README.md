# wiki
Encrypted wiki/dairy/notes powered by vimwiki, markdown, and gpg

Note: this wiki setup uses my simple [wiki script](https://github.com/skovati/scripts/blob/master/wiki) in order to manage encryption, editing, and git anywhere on my system.

## usage

`wiki [command]`

decrypts and opens vimwiki in $EDITOR
`wiki edit`

encrypts with gpg public key and commits and pushes to remote git repo
`wiki push`
